## Translating enchantment names

All enchantments are using minecraft's translatable components for their names. This means that you can use a resource
pack with a language file adding translations for the enchantments. Language will be picked based on the player's locale
and will default to capitalized default name in english if no translation is found.

You can find translation keys for all the enchantments in the [enchantment list](/documentation/enchant-list/).
